Update Map

V1) Radar Tracking and Displays

1.1.x - Input Output and basic internal math for fixed array radars

1.2.x - Adds ability to save and merge targets for use with rotating radar domes also adds tweakables to optimize settings for specific deployments

1.3.x - Adds ability to dynamically adjust target merging parameters for scanning and rotating radars to correct for movement of radar platform such as if deployed on an aircraft or ship

1.4.x - adds dynamically tweakable values to make fine tuning easier and to allow tweaking without editing the code

1.5.x - adds internal mapping in both local polar and absolute cartesian coordinate system

1.6.x - basic video display output for tracked targets based on local polar locations

1.7.x - upgraded video output with overlay onto satelite map using absolute cartesian coordinates

1.8.x - dynamic switching between video modes from 1.5 and 1.6 patches and zooming




V2) two stage seek and lock systems for detailed tracking

V3) output to turrets

V4) correct for turret types
